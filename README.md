# neural-network-self-driving-car

The 'self-driving car' is a creation by Radu Mariescu Istodor.

You can find a more sophisticated version on 
        https://radufromfinland.com/

More importantly, you can learn how to build it yourself in his great free course on 
        https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/self-driving-car-javascript/ 
In this course you get introduced in neural networks and genetic algorithms.

To make the code work, I had to refactor sensor.js (added an if-statement) and road.js (changed a for-loop). Check the files.
